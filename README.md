## 🌟 Overview

**ASHA AI** is a revolutionary voice-first healthcare platform designed to democratize healthcare access for rural Indian women. Built to work on low-end devices with intermittent connectivity, ASHA AI empowers women who face literacy barriers, social stigma, and limited access to healthcare professionals.

### 🎯 Mission

To provide dignified, private, and accessible healthcare guidance to underserved rural communities while supercharging the existing ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workforce with intelligent digital tools.

## 🚨 The Problem

### **Meet Radha**
Radha is 19 years old, pregnant, and anemic. She lives in a village in Bihar where:

- ❌ **Literacy Barrier**: Cannot read medical pamphlets or text-based health apps
- ❌ **Social Stigma**: Too shy to discuss reproductive health with family or male doctors
- ❌ **Overburdened System**: Her ASHA worker visits once a month and manages 1,000+ villagers

> *"I have questions, but I don't know who to ask..."* - Radha, 19

### The Statistics
- 📊 **300 million** rural women lack accessible healthcare guidance
- 🏥 **1 ASHA worker** per 1,000 population
- 📱 **95%** of users cannot download mobile apps due to constraints
- 🔴 **High maternal mortality** due to delayed interventions
